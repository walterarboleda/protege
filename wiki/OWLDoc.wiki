The *OWLDoc plug-in* was originally developed by [http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~horridgm/ Matthew Horridge] as part of the [http://www.co-ode.org/ CO-ODE project] at [http://www.manchester.ac.uk/ The University of Manchester].  The CO-ODE project officially finished in August of 2009.  Since then, the [http://protege.stanford.edu/aboutus/aboutus.html Protege team] at Stanford has taken over support and maintenance of OWLDoc.

The web page for the original version of OWLDoc is [http://www.co-ode.org/downloads/owldoc/ still available] on the CO-ODE website.
