# Description #

The **OWLDoc plug-in** was originally developed by [Matthew Horridge](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~horridgm/) as part of the [CO-ODE project](http://www.co-ode.org/) at [The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/).  The CO-ODE project officially finished in August of 2009.  Since then, the [Protege team](http://protege.stanford.edu/aboutus/aboutus.html) at Stanford has taken over support and maintenance of OWLDoc.

The web page for the original version of OWLDoc is [still available](http://www.co-ode.org/downloads/owldoc/) on the CO-ODE website.

# Download #
